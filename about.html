        Hi! Glad you're here. <br> <br>
        This site is mostly a hosting platform for my portfolio, but is also a good way for me to practice my website building. This color scheme of alice blue and white is one I've used fairly often in my classwork, and I'm glad to be able to use it here in a more official capacity. <br> <br>
        As for myself, I'm an avid reader, student, and gamer. I love the works of Terry Pratchett, and most games put out by Nintendo. I'm halfway through my Associate's Degree in Web Development, and graduated a certificate in IT Foundations Cum Laude.
