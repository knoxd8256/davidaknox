    <p>I am currently a Web Development student at Durham Tech, in Durham, NC. I am one year into my Associate's Degree, having completed my certificate in Technology Foundations, and I am proficient in PHP, HTML5, and CSS. This site, as well as all of the ones in my portfolio, were made entirely from scratch using these technologies.</p>
