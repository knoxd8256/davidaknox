      <p>
        Here I have a portfolio of sites I have built either as practice, for people around me, or for class. Some are hosted as subsets of this site, some are hosted elsewhere.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> <a href="https://johntheartist.net">John The Artist</a>. This is a website I built for my dad, an artist. This site went through many rewrites, and is subject to change at a moment's notice.</li>
        <li><a href="portfolio/nursery/index.html">Nursery</a>. This is a rewrite of the website for a home nursery I built as a bit of practice. The real website can be found at<a href="https://www.morningsongnursery.com/"> www.morningsongnursery.com</a></li>
        <li><a href="portfolio/varsity/index.html">The Varsity</a>. This is a rewrite of the website for the Varsity, a local theater. This was done for practice, and is in no way endorsed by or representative of the Varsity, whose real website can be found at <a href="https://varsityonfranklin.com/">https://varsityonfranklin.com/</a></li>
	<li><a href="portfolio/designments/David(10.03.19)/index.html">Pumpkin Patch Demo</a></a>
